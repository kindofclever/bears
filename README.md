### Recursion 
A function is called recursive when it calls itself. Here are two example of non recursive functions turned into a recursive ones.

```
const countDown = (number) => {
  for (i = number; i >= 0; i--) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log('Happy new year!');
};

const countDownRecursive = (number) => {
    if (number <= 0) {
        console.log('Happy new year!');
        return;
    }
    console.log(number); 
    countDownRecursive(number - 1);
};

------

const sumUp = (number) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
};

const sumUpRecursive = (number, total = 0) => {
    if (number <= 0) {
        return total;
    }
    return sumUpRecursive(number - 1, total + number);
};

```

To prevent the function from running endlessly it needs a breakout clause at the beginning of its body. If this clause isnÂ´t met, it will run again and again, because the function calls itself.

When the statement in the breakout clause is met, the return keyword will end the execution.

In the second example we pass in a parameter with a default value to give the function a place to store its calculations. This is a way of memoization.
