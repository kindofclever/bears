## Knowledge that helps understanding LeetCode challenges

### Recursion

A function is called recursive when it calls itself. Here are two example of non
recursive functions turned into a recursive ones.

1. example

```
const countDown = (number) => {
  for (i = number; i >= 0; i--) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log('Happy new year!');
};

const countDownRecursive = (number) => {
    if (number <= 0) {
        console.log('Happy new year!');
        return;
    }
    console.log(number);
    countDownRecursive(number - 1);
};

```

2. example

```
const sumUp = (number) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
};

const sumUpRecursive = (number, total = 0) => {
    if (number <= 0) {
        return total;
    }
    return sumUpRecursive(number - 1, total + number);
};

```

To prevent the function from running endlessly it needs a breakout clause at the
beginning of its body. If this clause isnÂ´t met, it will run again and again,
because the function calls itself.

When the statement in the breakout clause is met, the return keyword will end
the execution. If there is no breakout clause the function will cause a stack
overflow at one point.

In the second example we pass in a parameter with a default value to give the
function a place to store its calculations. This is a way of memoization.

### Iteration

A function is call iterative when there is a loop (or repetition).

### Big-o notation

Big-o is simplified the analysis to an algorithms efficiency. It's a way of
being able to compare the time and space a function needs to run.

### Linked Lists

A linked List is a chain of nodes which a property of (specific) data and a property for a pointer, often named "next". The reason it can be more efficient to store information in lined lists is that in comparison to arrays they take up much less memory space. If you add an element to an array JavaScript on a low level will store a complete new instance of this array, to not mess up the location of data. A linked list on the otherhand will just point to a new instance for a single element of information. 

This doesn't mean we should always use linked lists. One of the adventages using an array is the faster search for elements. [This article](https://towardsdatascience.com/linked-lists-vs-arrays-78746f983267) compares arrays and linked lists in more depth.

In this video you can find a very good explanation of how to create and
manipulate linked lists.
